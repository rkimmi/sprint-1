1.2 Command Line and GitHub
Question 1:

The command-line acts as means to navigate around and alter files and file directories. As opposed to navigating through your computer's files through clicking, the command-line allows you to modify files through typing simple or complex commands into the command-line. 

Question 2: Terminal command list;

ls = 'list file', ls will list known files within the current directory.
*Bonus* 'Options' such as; '-l' and '-a' used with the ls command can alter the list content and/or how the file list is formatted.

pwd = 'print working directory', pwd tells you exactly where you are within a/the file directory.

mkdir = 'make directory', mkdir will create a new directory within the  current location. e.g; 'mkdir joyful' creates a single directory titled 'joyful'.

cd = 'change directory', cd allows you to navigate between directories. From there, the cd command can take you to other locations within the Desktop directory... but not outside of it(?)

cd .. = cd .. acts as a kind of backspace which returns you to the previous directory outside of the current location.

mv = 'move', mv will move a specified file to another specified location.

cp = 'copy', cp will duplicate a specified file and place it within another specified location.

git clone = git clone will clone your github repositories directly to any chosen directory. :)

* = * allows you to select multiple files to manipulate simultaneously. Anything before and after * specifies qualities of file names, e.g; a*.txt will select any file which starts with 'a' and end in '.txt' within a located directory.

rm = 'remove', rm will permanently remove any specified file or directory.
